 * Most driver routines require that only certain bits of a register

 * To facilitate this, this header file contains a few convenience
 * macro definitions that perform most common operations, such as
 * modification of setting or clearing of individual bits, etc.
 *
 * This header file should be included to all driver source files
 * that perform bitwise operations on registers.
