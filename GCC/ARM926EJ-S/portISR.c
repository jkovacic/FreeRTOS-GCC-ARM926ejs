 * Since all ARM cores are functionally very similar, portISR.c from

 * ARM926EJ-S too.
 *
 * IRQ exception handling routine (vFreeRTOS_ISR) was added. Functions that
 * enable interrupt handling (vPortEnableInterruptsFromThumb and vPortExitCritical)
 * were modified so they do not enable FIQ interrupts that are currently not supported.
 * Additionally all "annoying" tabs have been replaced by spaces.

/*
    Changes from V2.5.2

    + The critical section management functions have been changed.  These no
      longer modify the stack and are safe to use at all optimisation levels.
      The functions are now also the same for both ARM and THUMB modes.

    Changes from V2.6.0

    + Removed the 'static' from the definition of vNonPreemptiveTick() to
      allow the demo to link when using the cooperative scheduler.

    Changes from V3.2.4

    + The assembler statements are now included in a single asm block rather
      than each line having its own asm block.
